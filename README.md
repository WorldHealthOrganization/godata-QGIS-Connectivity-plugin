# godata-QGIS-Connectivity-plugin
This is a Plugin for QGIS that enables users to login and extract data from Go.Data. Go.Data is an application which facilitates outbreak investigation, including field data collection, contact tracing, and visualization of chains of transmission. Go.Data utilizes Mongo.db, so this plugin will extract data from it utilizing APIs and transform the JSON output to formatted csv files. This Plugin was created to allow someone in the GIS role of outbreak emergency response to access the outbreak data from within QGIS, and extract case and contact data in order to create maps for outbreak investigation.

## Coming soon - this project is in progress!
